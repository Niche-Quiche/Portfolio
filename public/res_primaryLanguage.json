      "description": " I'm Noah Dirck, a Full-Stack Developer with a strong passion to learn and create. There is so much to learn in this industry that it can sometimes be overwhelming. I've figured out that finding new projects to feed my curiosity is the antidote to these kinds of worries. You know the old cliche: \"Its not about the destination, its about the journey\". Well it turns out that some cliches dont feel like cliches once they really resonate with you. So, to me, it's not always about the final product (probably a controversial thing to say as a developer). It's about the excitement that comes with the process of learning new technologies. Here's to future projects and staving off imposter syndrome! ðŸ¥‚",
